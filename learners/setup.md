### Discussion

The aim of this course is to familiarise you with the concept of Research Data Management and help you consider what actions should be taken to ensure transparency, integrity and accountability in research. The information provided in this course is not exhaustive, therefore some useful resources have been linked below. Research does not have a one size fits all approach, either does data management. It is best to check the resources which reflect your faculty/ departments as internal Research Data Management policies may differ.
